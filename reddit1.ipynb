Only three of the 14 tests the group evaluated were reliable. Four of the tests had false positive rates that ranged from 11 to 16 percent. “Those numbers are just unacceptable,” Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told The New York Times. “If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.” _\n",

Might have been just been a sick cow and there's no human to human transfer. He could have been causing panic for no reason. It's great that you now months later know the doctor was warning about something serious, though you don't talk about hundreds of doctors currently in jail that did the same about viruses that didn't end up being this serious.

In order for testing to bring about any sense of safety, you either have to: 1 - isolate yourself from the outside world, or 2 - repeatedly test everyone every few days. If you’re not willing to do either one of those than testing everyone once is a feel good measure that accomplishes nothing in terms of changing the reality on the ground. \n",
